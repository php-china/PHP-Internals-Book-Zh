Testing with ``.phpt`` files
============================

Tests are a great way to get your foot in the door of PHP internals. You don't even need to know C in order to get
started because all the tests are written in PHP.

In this chapter we'll explore the test suite that covers the internal functionality of PHP. We'll cover everything from
running the test suite with PHP's custom black-box testing tool called ``run-tests.php`` to creating new tests.

The following sections still need to be written:

* Finding untested code (finding_untested_code)
* Environment variables (advanced/environment_variables)
* Redirect Tests (advanced/redirect_tests)
* Step debugging with GDB (advanced/step_debugging_with_gdb)
