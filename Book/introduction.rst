Introduction
============

This book is a collaborative effort between several PHP developers to better document and describe how PHP works
internally.

本书有三个主要目的：

 * Document and describe how PHP internals work.
 * Document and describe how to extend the language with extensions.
 * Document and describe how you can interact with the community to develop PHP itself.

本书主要针对有C语言经验的开发者，但是也尽可能地优化内容和补充所需背景知识，所以对C语言不是很熟悉的人，也可以理解本书的内容。
This book is primarily targeted at developers who have experience in the C programming language. However, where-ever
possible we will attempt to distill the information and summarize it so that developers who don't know C well, will
still be able to understand the content.

.. note:: Some of the introductory chapters have not been written yet (in particular the ones on creating basic
   extensions and declaring functions), so if you're completely new to PHP extension development you'll have to wait
   until the remaining introductory chapters are published or start off with other
   `resources on the topic <https://wiki.php.net/internals/references>`_.

The repository for this book is available on GitHub_. Please report issues and provide feedback on the `issue tracker`_.
