Zend Extensions
===============

PHP knows two kinds of extensions :

* The PHP extensions, the most commonly used
* The Zend extensions, more uncommon, allows other hooks

This chapter will detail what are the main differences between Zend extensions and PHP extensions, when you should use
one instead of the other, and how to build hybrid extensions, aka extensions being both PHP and Zend at the same time
(and why do that).

On differences between PHP and Zend extensions
**********************************************

Just to say. Into PHP's source code, PHP extensions are named as **"PHP modules"**, whereas Zend extensions are called
**"Zend extensions"**.

So into PHP's heart, if you read the "extension" keyword, you should first think about a Zend extension. And if you
read the "module" keyword, you may think about a PHP extension.

In traditional life, we talk about *"PHP extensions"* versus *"Zend extensions"*.

The thing that differentiate them is the way they are loaded :

* PHP extensions (aka PHP "modules") are loaded in INI files as a *"extension=pib.so"* line
* Zend extensions are loaded in INI files as a *"zend_extension=pib.so"* line

That's the only visible difference we see from PHP userland.

But that's a different story from internal point of view.

What is a Zend extension ?
**************************

First of all, Zend extensions are compiled and loaded the same way as PHP extensions. Thus, if you haven't yet read the
:doc:`building PHP extensions <../build_system/building_extensions>` chapter, you should have a look as it is valid
also for Zend extensions.

.. note:: If not done, :doc:`get some informations about PHP extensions <../extensions_design>` as we will compare
          against them here. Zend extensions share a very big part of concepts with PHP extensions.

Here is a Zend extension. Note that you need to publish not one but two structures for the engine to load your Zend
extension::

    /* Main Zend extension structure */
    struct _zend_extension {
        char *name;                                           /*
        char *version;                                         * Some infos
        char *author;                                          *
        char *URL;                                             *
        char *copyright;                                       */

        startup_func_t startup;                               /*
        shutdown_func_t shutdown;                              *  Specific branching lifetime points
        activate_func_t activate;                              *  ( Hooks )
        deactivate_func_t deactivate;                          */

        message_handler_func_t message_handler;               /* Hook called on zend_extension registration */

        op_array_handler_func_t op_array_handler;             /* Hook called just after Zend compilation */

        statement_handler_func_t statement_handler;           /*
        fcall_begin_handler_func_t fcall_begin_handler;        *  Hooks called through the Zend VM as specific OPCodes
        fcall_end_handler_func_t fcall_end_handler;            */

        op_array_ctor_func_t op_array_ctor;                   /* Hook called on OPArray construction */
        op_array_dtor_func_t op_array_dtor;                   /* Hook called on OPArray destruction */

        int (*api_no_check)(int api_no);                      /* Checks against zend_extension incompatibilities
        int (*build_id_check)(const char* build_id);           */

        op_array_persist_calc_func_t op_array_persist_calc;   /* Hooks called if the zend_extension extended the
        op_array_persist_func_t op_array_persist;              * OPArray structure and has some SHM data to declare
                                                               */

        void *reserved5;                                      /*
        void *reserved6;                                       * Do what you want with those free pointers
        void *reserved7;                                       *
        void *reserved8;                                       */

        DL_HANDLE handle;                                     /* dlopen() returned handle */
        int resource_number;                                  /* internal number used to manage that extension */
    };

    /* Structure used when the Zend extension gets loaded into the engine */
    typedef struct _zend_extension_version_info {
        int zend_extension_api_no;
        char *build_id;
    } zend_extension_version_info;

.. note:: As always, read the source. Zend extensions are managed into
          `Zend/zend_extension.c <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/57dba0e2f5e39f6b05031317048e39d463243cc3/Zend/
          zend_extensions.c>`_ (and .h)

Like you can notice, Zend extensions are more complex than PHP extensions, as they got more hooks, and those are much
closer to the :doc:`Zend engine and its Virtual Machine <../zend_engine>` (The most complex parts of the whole PHP
source code).

Why need a Zend extension ?
***************************

Let us warn you : until you have **very advanced** knowledge on PHP internal's Vritual Machine, and until you need to
hook deep into it, you shouldn't need a Zend extension, but a PHP extension will be enough.

Today's most commonly known Zend extensions into PHP's world are OPCache, XDebug, phpdbg and Blackfire. But you know
dozens of PHP extensions next to that don't you ?! That's a clear sign that :

* You should not need a Zend extension for a very big part of your problematics
* Zend extensions can also be used as PHP extensions (more on that later)
* A PHP extension still can do a lot of things.
* Usually, Zend extensions are needed for two kinds of tasks : debuggers and profilers.

.. note:: There is no :doc:`skeleton generator <extension_skeleton>` for Zend extensions, like for PHP extensions.

.. warning:: With Zend extensions, no generator, no help. Zend extensions are reserved to **advanced programmers**,
             they are more complex to understand, they got deeper-engine behaviors and usually require an advanced
             knowledge of PHP's internal machinery.

Basically, if you need to create a debugger, you'll need a Zend extension. For profilers, you can make some as
traditional PHP extensions, that can work and that depends on your needs.

Also, if you need to master extensions loading order, Zend extensions will help (we'll see that).

Finally, if your goal is "just" to *add* some new concepts (functions, classes, constants, etc...) to PHP, you'll use a
PHP extension, but if you need to *change* a current behavior of PHP, probably a Zend extension will be better.

We can't give rules here, but we can explain how all that stuff works, so that you get your own idea of the
capabilities brought by Zend extensions against PHP extensions.

Also, you may create an *hybrid* extension, which is both a Zend extension *and* a PHP extension (this is tricky but
perfectly valid and allows you to program in both "worlds" at the same time).

API versions and conflicts management
*************************************

You know that PHP extensions check against several rules before loading, to know if they are compatible with the PHP
version you try to load them on. This has been detailed into
:doc:`the chapter about building PHP extensions <../build_system/building_extensions>`.

For Zend extension, the same rules apply, but a little bit differently : it will use the
``zend_extension_version_info`` structure you published to know what to do.

The ``zend_extension_version_info`` structure you declare contain only two informations that the engine will use when
it starts loading your Zend extension :

* ``ZEND_EXTENSION_API_NO``
* ``ZEND_EXTENSION_BUILD_ID``

The ``ZEND_EXTENSION_API_NO`` is checked when your Zend extension is loaded. But the difference is that if this number
doesn't match your Zend extension's, you still have a chance to get loaded. The engine will call for your
``api_no_check()`` hook, if you declared one, and will pass it the current PHP runtime ``ZEND_EXTENSION_API_NO``. Here,
you must tell if you support that API number, or not, simply by returning that info to the engine. If you don't support,
the engine won't load your extension and print a warning message about that.

The same applies to the other ABI settings, such as ``ZEND_DEBUG``, or ``ZTS``. Where PHP extensions will refuse to
load if there is a mismatch, Zend extensions are given a chance to load as the engine checks against
``build_id_check()`` hook and pass it the ``ZEND_EXTENSION_BUILD_ID``. Here again, you say if you are compatible or not.
Here again, if you say "no", the engine won't load your extension and print a warning message about that.

Remember that we detail how API and ABI is numbered,
:doc:`in the chapter about building PHP extensions <../build_system/building_extensions>`.

Those abilities to force things against the engine are rarely used in practice.

.. note:: You see how more complex Zend extensions are compared to PHP extensions ? The engine is less restrictive, and
          it supposes that you know what you're doing, for the best or the worst.

.. warning:: Zend extensions should really be developped by experienced and advanced programmers, as the engine is
             weaker about its checks. It clearly supposes that you master what you're doing.

To sum things up about API compatibility, well, every step is detailed in
`zend_load_extension() <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/57dba0e2f5e39f6b05031317048e39d463243cc3/Zend/
zend_extensions.c#L67>`_.

Then comes the problem of Zend extensions conflicts. One may be incompatible with an other, and to master that, every
Zend extension has got a hook called ``message_handler``. If declared, this hook is triggered on every already loaded
extension when another Zend extension gets loaded. You are passed a pointer to its ``zend_extension`` structure, and you
may then detect which one it is, and abort if you think you'll confict with it. This is something rarely used in
practice as well.

Zend extensions lifetime hooks
******************************

If you remember about :doc:`the PHP lifecycle <php_lifecycle>` (you should read the dedicated chapter), well, Zend
extensions plug into that lifecycle this way:

.. image:: ./images/php_extensions_lifecycle_full.png
   :align: center

We can notice that our ``api_no_check()``, ``build_id_check()`` and ``message_handler()`` check hooks are only triggered
when PHP starts up. Those later three hooks are detailed in the preceding part (above).

Then the **important** thing to remember :

* ``MINIT()`` is triggered on PHP extensions **before** Zend extensions (``startup()``).
* ``RINIT()`` is triggered on Zend extensions (``activate()``) **before** PHP extensions.
* Zend extensions request shutdown procedure (``deactivate()``) is called **in between** ``RSHUTDOWN()`` and
  ``PRSHUTDOWN()`` for PHP extensions.
* ``MSHUTDOWN()`` is called on PHP extensions **first**, then on Zend extensions **after** (``shutdown()``).

.. warning:: Like for every hook, there is a precise defined order and you must master it and remember it for complex
             use-case extensions.

In *practice*, what we can say about it is that :

* Zend extensions are started **after** PHP extensions. That allows Zend extensions to be sure that every PHP extension
  is already loaded when they start. They are then able to replace-and-hook into PHP extensions. For example, if you need
  to replace the ``session_start()`` function handler by yours, it will be easier to do so in a Zend extension. If you do
  it in a PHP extension, you must be sure you get loaded after the session extension, and that can be tricky to check and
  to master (You still can specify a dependency using a `zend_module_dep <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/
  c18ba686cdf2d937475eb3d5c239e4ef8e733fa6/Zend/zend_modules.h#L118>`_).
  However, :doc:`remember <extension_skeleton>` that statically compiled extensions are always started before
  dynamically compiled ones. Thus, for the session use-case, this is not a problem as *ext/session* is loaded as static.
  Until some distributions (FreeBSD hear us) change that ...

* Zend extensions are triggered **before** PHP extensions when a request shows in. That means they got a chance to modify
  the engine about the current request to come, so that PHP extensions use that modified context. OPCache uses such a
  trick so that it can perform its complex tasks before any extension had a chance to prevent it to.

* Same for request shutdown : Zend extensions can assume every PHP extension has shut down the request.

Practice : my first example Zend extension
******************************************

Here we'll detail in practice some hooks Zend extensions can use, and what to do with them, in some very simple scenario.

.. warning:: Remember that Zend extensions design usually require that you master the
             :doc:`Zend engine <../zend_engine>` deeply.

For our example here, we're gonna design a Zend extension that uses those hooks :

* ``fcall_begin_handler`` : We'll detect what instructions are currently being executed by the VM, and print a message.
  The hook catches two things : a call to require/include/eval or a call to any function/method.
* ``op_array_handler`` : We'll detect what PHP function is currently being compiled, and print a message.
* ``message_handler`` : We'll detect other Zend extensions loaded, and print a message.

Here is then our skeleton, that we must write ourselves as for Zend extensions, there is no skeleton generator like for
PHP extensions. The files are called *pib.c* and *php_pib.h* , the structure of the files stays the same as for PHP
extensions, simply we won't declare in there the same things::

    #include "php.h"
    #include "Zend/zend_extensions.h"
    #include "php_pib.h"
    #include "Zend/zend_smart_str.h"

    /* Remember that we must declare such a symbol in a Zend extension. It is used to check
     * if it was built against the same API as the one PHP runtime uses */
    zend_extension_version_info extension_version_info = {
        ZEND_EXTENSION_API_NO,
     ZEND_EXTENSION_BUILD_ID
    };

    zend_extension zend_extension_entry = {
        "pib-zend-extension",
        "1.0",
        "PHPInternalsBook Authors",
        "http://www.phpinternalsbook.com",
        "Our Copyright",
        NULL,                               /* startup() : module startup */
        NULL,                               /* shutdown() : module shutdown */
        pib_zend_extension_activate,        /* activate() : request startup */
        pib_zend_extension_deactivate,      /* deactivate() : request shutdown */
        pib_zend_extension_message_handler, /* message_handler() */

        pib_zend_extension_op_array_handler,      /* compiler op_array_handler() */
        NULL,                                     /* VM statement_handler() */
        pib_zend_extension_fcall_begin_handler,   /* VM fcall_begin_handler() */
        NULL,                                     /* VM fcall_end_handler() */
        NULL,                                     /* compiler op_array_ctor() */
        NULL,                                     /* compiler op_array_dtor() */
        STANDARD_ZEND_EXTENSION_PROPERTIES        /* Structure-ending macro */
    };

    static void pib_zend_extension_activate(void) { }

    static void pib_zend_extension_deactivate(void) { }

    static void pib_zend_extension_message_handler(int code, void *ext) { }

    static void pib_zend_extension_op_array_handler(zend_op_array *op_array) { }

    static void pib_zend_extension_fcall_begin_handler(zend_execute_data *ex) { }

So far so good, this extension compiles as a Zend extension, but does nothing. Not really nothing.
The first lines in the ``zend_extension`` structure appear in the ``phpinfo()``::

    This program makes use of the Zend Scripting Language Engine:
    Zend Engine v3.1.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2017 Zend Technologies
        with pib-zend-extension v1.0, Our Copyright, by PHPInternalsBook Authors

This is mandatory, the engine reacts like this : it prints the first ``zend_extension`` fields into engine
informations, for every loaded Zend extension.

That's all for now. Let's fill-in those empty-body functions now::

    static void pib_zend_extension_message_handler(int code, void *ext)
    {
        php_printf("We just detected that zend_extension '%s' is trying to load\n", ((zend_extension *)ext)->name);
    }

Like said before, ``message_handler()`` is a special hook that Zend extensions may declare to be noticed when another
Zend extension get loaded. Be carefull however of the order. You must register our "pib" Zend extension first, then
another Zend extension (like OPCache) after that, as the ``message_handler()`` is only called when a Zend extension is
loaded you obviously need to be loaded before to declare it. Chicken and egg.

Then we'll start to dive into the engine, with our ``op_array_handler`` hook::

    static void pib_zend_extension_op_array_handler(zend_op_array *op_array)
    {
        smart_str out = {0};

        smart_str_appends(&out, "We just compiled ");

        if (op_array->function_name) {
            uint32_t i, num_args = op_array->num_args;

            if (op_array->fn_flags & ZEND_ACC_CLOSURE) {
                smart_str_appends(&out, "a closure ");
            } else {
                smart_str_appends(&out, "function ");
                smart_str_append(&out, op_array->function_name);
            }
            smart_str_appendc(&out, '(');

            /* The variadic arg is not declared as an arg internally */
            if (op_array->fn_flags & ZEND_ACC_VARIADIC) {
                num_args++;
            }
            for (i=0; i<num_args; i++) {
                zend_arg_info arg = op_array->arg_info[i];

                if (arg.class_name) {
                    smart_str_append(&out, arg.class_name);
                    smart_str_appendc(&out, ' ');
                }
                if (arg.pass_by_reference) {
                    smart_str_appendc(&out, '&');
                }
                if (arg.is_variadic) {
                    smart_str_appends(&out, "...");
                }
                smart_str_appendc(&out, '$');
                smart_str_append(&out, arg.name);
                if (i != num_args - 1) {
                    smart_str_appends(&out, ", ");
                }
            }

            smart_str_appends(&out, ") in file ");
            smart_str_append(&out, op_array->filename);
            smart_str_appends(&out, " between line ");
            smart_str_append_unsigned(&out, op_array->line_start);
            smart_str_appends(&out, " and line ");
            smart_str_append_unsigned(&out, op_array->line_end);
        } else {
            smart_str_appends(&out, "the file ");
            smart_str_append(&out, op_array->filename);
        }

        smart_str_0(&out);
        php_printf("%s\n", ZSTR_VAL(out.s));
        smart_str_free(&out);
    }

.. note:: Get some informations :doc:`about the Zend Engine <../zend_engine>` if you need.

This hook is triggered by the pass two of the compiler. When the Zend compiler fires in, it compiles a script or a
function. Just before ending, it launches a second compiling pass which goal is to resolve unresolved pointers (which
value couldn't be known while compiling the script). This is the ``pass_two()`` function
`which source code <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/81c2a4b9ba0816a0bda4f004aeca634ad8b58970/Zend/
zend_opcode.c#L577>`_ you can analyze.

In the ``pass_two()`` source code, you can see that it triggers the ``op_array_handler()`` of every registered Zend
extension so far, and it passes it as argument the current not-fully-resolved-yet OPArray. This is what we get as
argument in our function. We then analyze it, and try to pull out some informations about it, like the
currently-being-compiled function, its arguments informations etc...  Something very close to what the Reflection API
does, we are just a little bit less accurate here, as the OPArray is not fully resolved, we are still part of the
compilation step here. We could have gathered the default argument values f.e (which is not done here), but that would
have added so much complexity to the example that we decided not to show such a part.

.. note:: Remember that :doc:`smart_str are detailed here <../internal_types/strings/smart_str>`,
          :doc:`zvals here <../internal_types/zvals>`, :doc:`OPArrays here <../zend_engine/main_structures>`, etc...

        }
        PHPWRITE("\n", 1);
    }

On request startup, we tell the compiler to generate some extended informations into the OPArray it's going to create.
The flag for that is ``ZEND_COMPILE_EXTENDED_INFO``. Extended informations are VM OPCode hooks, that is the compiler
will generate a special OPCode before every function is called, and after every function call is finished. Those are
``FCALL_BEGIN`` and ``FCALL_END`` OPCodes.

Here is an exemple of a simple PHP function call OPCodes, with the 'foo' string as first solo argument:

.. code-block:: text

     L9    #1     INIT_FCALL              112                  "foo"
     L9    #2     SEND_VAL                "foo"                1
     L9    #3     DO_FCALL
     L11   #4     RETURN                  1

Now the same once we told the compiler to generate additionnal OPCodes:

.. code-block:: text

     L9    #3     INIT_FCALL              112                  "foo"
     L9    #4     EXT_FCALL_BEGIN
     L9    #5     SEND_VAL                "foo"                1
     L9    #6     DO_FCALL
     L9    #7     EXT_FCALL_END
     L11   #8     RETURN                  1

Like you can see, the OPCodes about sending the argument and calling the function have been surrounded by two
``EXT_FCALL_BEGIN`` and ``EXT_FCALL_END`` OPCodes, those two later will execute ``fcall_begin()`` and ``fcall_end()``
handlers of every declared Zend extensions, like ours.

Remember that a function call, into the engine, is whether a true function call, or the execution of a new included PHP
file, or the execution of a new ``eval()`` block. Look at the ``require()`` disassembled:

.. code-block:: text

     L9    #3     EXT_FCALL_BEGIN
     L9    #4     INCLUDE_OR_EVAL         "foo.php"
     L9    #5     EXT_FCALL_END
     L11   #6     RETURN                  1

Once those "marker" OPCodes have been generated, when the VM runs the OPArray OPCodes, it will run our ``fcall_begin()``
handler we declared. That's for us a way to detect what function/file/eval is going to be executed just next. We
simply print such information.

.. note:: Asking the compiler to generate ``EXT_FCALL`` statements will slow down the executor a lot. About four times
          slower to run the exact same code. ``EXT_FCALL`` should be used for debuggers only, or at least not for
          production code as the Zend VM executor is much slower with them activated : this is more code to run for
          every fcall/include/eval.

Hybrid extensions
*****************

What we call hybrid extensions, are extensions that are **both** Zend extensions, and PHP extensions.

How is that possible ? And what for ?.

Well there are several answers to such a question :

* To :doc:`register new PHP functions <php_functions>`, a PHP extension is better than a Zend extension, as it already
  knows how to do and has been designed for that specific purpose first. That would be pitty not to use it. OPCache
  does that.
* If you need to register about all the hooks in the full lifecycle, you'll obviously need both sides
* If you need to master the order Zend extensions are loaded, f.e to get loaded after OPCache, you will need to be
  hybrid

The trick is simple, choose between :

* You are a PHP extension mainly. You get registered as a PHP extension, and when you start (``MINIT()``), you register
  yourself as a Zend Extension (slave).
* You are a Zend extension mainly. You get registered as a Zend extension, and when you start (``startup()``), you
  register yourself as a PHP Extension (slave).

So whether you are a PHP extension master and a Zend extension slave ; Or the opposite flavor.

As for the trick to be fully understood, we repeat here the full lifecycle of PHP and Zend extensions. Picture-print it
into your brain :

.. image:: ./images/php_extensions_lifecycle_full.png
   :align: center

Remember however, whatever schema you choose to go with, you'll have to register the slave part and trigger it by hand,
as the engine obviously won't do it. The engine triggers automaticaly the master part.

Hybrid Zend extension master, PHP extension slave
-------------------------------------------------

Ok that is easy. We don't want to be loaded as a PHP extension, but exclusively as a Zend extension. To force things,
we won't publish the mandatory symbol ``get_module`` that the engine looks for when it tried to register a PHP
extension from reading the INI file.

Thus, we will only be able to be registered as a *zend_extension=pib.so*. Registering as *extension=pib.so* will fail,
as the engine will fail to find our not-exported ``get_module`` symbol.

But, in our startup hook of Zend extension, nothing prevents us from registering ourselves as a PHP extension::

    #include "php.h"
    #include "Zend/zend_extensions.h"
    #include "php_pib.h"

    #define PRINT(what) fprintf(stderr, what "\n");

    /* Declared as static, thus private */
    static zend_module_entry pib_module_entry = {
        STANDARD_MODULE_HEADER,
        "pib",
        NULL, /* Function entries */
        PHP_MINIT(pib), /* Module init */
        PHP_MSHUTDOWN(pib), /* Module shutdown */
        PHP_RINIT(pib), /* Request init */
        PHP_RSHUTDOWN(pib), /* Request shutdown */
        NULL, /* Module information */
        "0.1", /* Replace with version number for your extension */
        STANDARD_MODULE_PROPERTIES
    };

    /* This line should stay commented
    ZEND_GET_MODULE(pib)
    */

    zend_extension_version_info extension_version_info = {
        ZEND_EXTENSION_API_NO,
        ZEND_EXTENSION_BUILD_ID
    };

    zend_extension zend_extension_entry = {
        "pib-zend-extension",
        "1.0",
        "PHPInternalsBook Authors",
        "http://www.phpinternalsbook.com",
        "Our Copyright",
        pib_zend_extension_startup,
        pib_zend_extension_shutdown,
        pib_zend_extension_activate,
        pib_zend_extension_deactivate,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,

        STANDARD_ZEND_EXTENSION_PROPERTIES
    };

    static void pib_zend_extension_activate(void)
    {
        PRINT("Zend extension new request starting up");
    }

    static void pib_zend_extension_deactivate(void)
    {
        PRINT("Zend extension current request is shutting down");
    }

    static int pib_zend_extension_startup(zend_extension *ext)
    {
        PRINT("Zend extension is starting up");

        /* When the Zend extension part will startup(), make it register
           a PHP extension by calling ourselves zend_startup_module() */
        return zend_startup_module(&pib_module_entry);
    }

    static void pib_zend_extension_shutdown(zend_extension *ext)
    {
        PRINT("Zend extension is shutting down");
    }

    static PHP_MINIT_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        PRINT("PHP extension is starting up");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

    static PHP_MSHUTDOWN_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        PRINT("PHP extension is shutting down");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

    static PHP_RINIT_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        PRINT("PHP extension new request starting up");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

    static PHP_RSHUTDOWN_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        PRINT("PHP extension current request is shutting down");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

We are done. Starting PHP with such a Zend extension activated will print the following on stderr::

    Zend extension is starting up
    PHP extension is starting up
    Zend extension new request starting up
    PHP extension new request starting up
    PHP extension current request is shutting down
    Zend extension current request is shutting down
    PHP extension is shutting down
    Zend extension is shutting down

Like you can see, the hooks are honored in the right order, except the first two ones. Theoretically, PHP extensions
should startup before Zend extensions, but as we got registered as a Zend extension, when the engine runs our Zend
extension hook, it knows nothing about our PHP extension module startup part (``MINIT()``) yet. We tell it to start our
PHP extension up, and then as part of Zend extension ``startup()`` hook, we make it trigger the PHP extension startup
hook by hand, by callling for ``zend_startup_module()``. Obviously you'll have to take care not to create a circular
loop and not to make the engine crazy about what you will concretely do in such hooks.

It is perfectly both easy and logical.

From now, we are both a PHP extension and a Zend extension. Look at that::

    > php -dzend_extension=pib.so -m
    [PHP modules]
    Core
    date
    (...)
    pib
    posix
    Reflection
    (...)

    [Zend Modules]
    pib-zend-extension

Our PHP extension is effectively called "pib" and shows up, and our Zend extension is effectively called
"pib-zend-extension" and shows up as well. We chose two different names for both parts, we could have chosen the same
name.

.. note:: OPCache and Xdebug use such an hybrid model, they are Zend extensions, but they need to publish PHP
          functions and thus they are also PHP extensions to do so.

Hybrid PHP extension master, Zend extension slave
-------------------------------------------------

Now let's go for the other way around : we want to be registered by the engine as a PHP extension, and not as a
Zend extension, but still want to be hybrid.

Well, we'll do the opposite : we won't publish our ``zend_extension_version_info`` symbol, this way it will be
impossible to load us as a Zend extension : the engine will deny that. But obviously this time, we'll declare a
``get_module`` symbol to be able to get loaded as a PHP extension. And, in our ``MINIT()``, we'll register ourselves as
a Zend extension ::

    #include "php.h"
    #include "Zend/zend_extensions.h"
    #include "php_pib.h"
    #include "Zend/zend_smart_str.h"

    #define PRINT(what) fprintf(stderr, what "\n");

    zend_module_entry pib_module_entry = {
        STANDARD_MODULE_HEADER,
        "pib",
        NULL, /* Function entries */
        PHP_MINIT(pib), /* Module init */
        PHP_MSHUTDOWN(pib), /* Module shutdown */
        PHP_RINIT(pib), /* Request init */
        PHP_RSHUTDOWN(pib), /* Request shutdown */
        NULL, /* Module information */
        "0.1", /* Replace with version number for your extension */
        STANDARD_MODULE_PROPERTIES
    };

    ZEND_GET_MODULE(pib)

    /* Should be kept commented
     * zend_extension_version_info extension_version_info = {
     *   ZEND_EXTENSION_API_NO,
     *    ZEND_EXTENSION_BUILD_ID
     * };
     */

    static zend_extension zend_extension_entry = {
        "pib-zend-extension",
        "1.0",
        "PHPInternalsBook Authors",
        "http://www.phpinternalsbook.com",
        "Our Copyright",
        pib_zend_extension_startup,
        pib_zend_extension_shutdown,
        pib_zend_extension_activate,
        pib_zend_extension_deactivate,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL,

        STANDARD_ZEND_EXTENSION_PROPERTIES
    };

    static void pib_zend_extension_activate(void)
    {
        PRINT("Zend extension new request starting up");
    }

    static void pib_zend_extension_deactivate(void)
    {
        PRINT("Zend extension current request is shutting down");
    }

    static int pib_zend_extension_startup(zend_extension *ext)
    {
        PRINT("Zend extension is starting up");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

    static PHP_MINIT_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        PRINT("PHP extension is starting up");

        /* Register our zend_extension part now */
        zend_register_extension(&zend_extension_entry, NULL);

        return SUCCESS;
    }

    static void pib_zend_extension_shutdown(zend_extension *ext)
    {
        PRINT("Zend extension is shutting down");
    }

    static PHP_MSHUTDOWN_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        PRINT("PHP extension is shutting down");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

    static PHP_RINIT_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        PRINT("PHP extension new request starting up");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

    static PHP_RSHUTDOWN_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        PRINT("PHP extension current request is shutting down");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

And that crashes badly just at the end (sad !), at ``pib_zend_extension_shutdown()``. Firing a debugger, it is easy to
know why.

Here, we are loaded as a PHP extension. Look at the hooks. When hitting ``MSHUTDOWN()``, the engine runs our
``MSHUTDOWN()``, but **it unloads us** just after that ! It calls for ``dlclose()`` on our extension,
`look at the source code <https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/4d6100569b7611ef66086bec96fe8b5046e30ef7/Zend/
zend_API.c#L2527>`_, the solution is as often located in there.

So what happens is easy, just after trigerring our ``RSHUTDOWN()``, the engine unloads our *pib.so* ; when it comes to
call our Zend extension part ``shutdown()``, we are not part of the process address space anymore, thus we badly crash
the entire PHP process.

What is the solution ? Well if you read the source, and if you read the other chapters of this book, you should know
that if we pass an env ``ZEND_DONT_UNLOAD_MODULES`` and put it to 1 , the engine won't unload us. We could then write
such an env in ``MSHUTDOWN()``, and unwrite it in ``shutdown()``.
`putenv() <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/putenv.3.html>`_ will do the job. That's fine even if that's tricky.
Also, if another extension between us plays with that, that will smell for us.

The second solution is less portable but safer/stronger, and calls for your knowledge of how libdl works.
`Read libdl manual <https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlopen>`_, and you'll find a
`glibc <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>`_-only solution.

That solution is to increment the refcount of the libdl handle, by calling ``dlopen()`` one more time for our extension.
That way, when the engine will ``dlclose()`` us, libdl will simply decrement the refcount of the shared object (ourselves),
but won't close it until the last reference (us) does so.
But ``dlopen()`` takes a full path to the object to open, and we don't know our own location path (where will be located
our *pib.so* on the runtime environment ?). To get that path, we'll have to call for
`dladdr() <https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlopen>`_ , but ``dladdr()`` is glibc only. We are less portable here, but we are
clearly safe. If you run on a system which doesn't use glibc (very unlikely), get some informations about it to know if
it supports ``dladdr()`` call or an alternative.

.. note:: That is one drawback of the C language : the lack of definition when it was born back in 1970 makes its usage
          often platform dependant. You have to master the platforms you target.

The closing part, will be part of the unload of the Zend extension, and for that we'll have to share the libdl handle
between the ``zend_module_entry``, and the ``zend_extension``.

Code patched::

    static PHP_MINIT_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        Dl_info infos;

        PRINT("PHP extension is starting up");

        /* Register our zend_extension part, and share our libdl handle so that
           the zend_extension shutdown step in the engine will dlclose() us */
        zend_register_extension(&zend_extension_entry, pib_module_entry.handle);

        /* Get our full path filename at runtime */
        dladdr(ZEND_MODULE_STARTUP_N(pib), &infos);

        /* Increment our libdl's handle refcount by reopening ourselves */
        dlopen(infos.dli_fname, 0);

        return SUCCESS;
    }

If you launch it now, you'll get the expected result::

    PHP extension is starting up
    Zend extension is starting up
    Zend extension new request starting up
    PHP extension new request starting up
    PHP extension current request is shutting down
    Zend extension current request is shutting down
    PHP extension is shutting down
    Zend extension is shutting down

.. note:: Blackfire uses such an hybrid model but hasn't got a Zend extension shutdown() hook and thus doesn't need the
          patch about module unload.

Hybrid hybrid
-------------

Hybrid hybrid is simply a model where you allow the user to load you whether as Zend extension or PHP extension.

What you have to do, is remember how you've been loaded, using a global for example, so that you can take care of both
modes.

Let's write just the diff parts::

    static char started = 0;

    static int pib_zend_extension_startup(zend_extension *ext)
    {
        if (!started) {
            started = 1;
            return zend_startup_module(&pib_module_entry);
        }

        PRINT("Zend extension is starting up");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

    static PHP_MINIT_FUNCTION(pib)
    {
        if (!started)    {
            started = 1;
            Dl_info infos;
            zend_register_extension(&zend_extension_entry, pib_module_entry.handle);

            dladdr(ZEND_MODULE_STARTUP_N(pib), &infos);
            dlopen(infos.dli_fname, 0);
        }

        PRINT("PHP extension is starting up");

        return SUCCESS;
    }

Obviously every symbol must be public. With the code above, you can get loaded as PHP extension (extension=pib.so) or
as Zend extension (zend_extension=pib.so) ; end-user will have choice, that's the advantage of such a model, even if
we authors are not aware of its usage.
