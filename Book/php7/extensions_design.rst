Extensions design
=================

In this chapter you'll learn how to design PHP extensions. You'll learn about the PHP lifecycle, how and when to manage 
memory, the different hooks you can use or the different function pointers you can replace to actively change PHP's 
internal machinery. You'll design PHP functions and classes to provide them through your extension, and you'll play 
with INI settings.
